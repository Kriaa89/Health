# MedconnectTunisia Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive healthcare management system tailored for modern medical facilities in Tunisia. It provides a range of modules to manage different aspects of healthcare services, ensuring a scalable and maintainable solution.

## Project Structure

- **readme.md**: This file contains an overview and documentation of the project.
- **MedHealth/**: The main application directory containing the core codebase.
  - **accounts/**: Manages user authentication, profiles, and account-related operations.
  - **doctors/**: Contains functionalities related to doctor management, scheduling, and related operations.
  - **nurses/**: Manages nurse-specific functionalities and scheduling.
  - **static/**: Stores all static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
  - **venv/Lib/**: Houses the Python virtual environment libraries, ensuring that all dependencies are isolated and managed.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Likely Django or a similar web framework (to be confirmed based on further configurations), providing a robust foundation for rapid development and scalability.
- **Frontend Technologies:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building interactive and responsive user interfaces.
- **Database:** Depending on deployment, could be SQLite, PostgreSQL, or another relational database system.
- **Virtual Environment:** A dedicated Python virtual environment (located in MedHealth/venv) is used to manage dependencies and maintain consistency across development environments.

## Additional Details

- **Modular Design:** The project is divided into distinct modules (accounts, doctors, nurses) to isolate domain-specific logic, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
- **Static Content Management:** All frontend assets are managed within the static directory, supporting a clear separation between backend logic and frontend presentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:** Navigate to the MedHealth directory and activate the virtual environment located in `venv/Lib`.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies (check the requirements.txt file if available).
4. **Run the Application:** Configure the necessary settings and run the development server.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome. Please follow best practices for clean code structure and ensure that any new modules integrate smoothly with the existing framework.
